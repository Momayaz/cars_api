# cars_api

## creating an API that contains name of the car, type of that car, a tiny description about it, the minimum price and an image of the car.
## I customized the API according to the type of the car, where you can only get the data of certain car. For example, if you hit mercedes in the search, it will get the whole data for only mercedes cars.
